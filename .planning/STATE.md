# Project State

## Project Reference

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 4 (Robust Shell & Now Playing) — PLANNED
Plan: 0 of 3 executed (03-01, 03-02, 03-03 ready)
Status: Phase 3 planned; ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-27 — Phase 3 planned (RESEARCH.md + 3 plans)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

**By Phase:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Media-key fix = settings toggle (not dynamic registration)
- prev/next via player bar buttons (not queue DOM walk)
- Blur-hide tied to alwaysOnTop (no new setting)
- CI = single GitHub Actions workflow
- AppX/MS Store dropped this milestone
- Jest ESM fix: custom transformer (jest.esm-transformer.js) downlevels jsdom 28's ESM-only deps

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GSD subagents not installed — research/roadmap work runs inline (install: `npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest --global`)
- Brownfield codebase docs at .planning/codebase/ — read CONCERNS.md before planning phases
